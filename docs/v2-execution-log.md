# Codevira v2.0 — Execution Log

> Running journal of what shipped, what changed, what we learned. Updated at the end of each hero sprint and at every public alpha checkpoint. Brief — full design rationale lives in per-hero specs (`docs/heroes/`).

---

## How to read this log

- **By week** for chronology.
- **By hero** for deeper view of any specific feature's evolution.
- **Each entry**: ~1 page max. Keep it scannable.
- **Always include**: what shipped, what surprised us, what we'd do differently, what's next.

## Week 0 — Planning lockdown (2026-05-03)

### Decisions made tonight

- **v1.9 → v2.0 rename.** Scope grew to 10 heroes + new engine architecture + universal multi-tool coverage. Major version bump is semver-correct and signals magnitude to users.
- **Vision locked**: per-project memory across every AI tool the developer uses. NOT universal cross-project memory.
- **All 10 heroes ship in v2.0 GA**, not staged across releases. Founder chose "all-in-one" over staged approach. 14-week timeline accepted.
- **Per-hero focused planning.** This master plan stays high-level; each hero gets `docs/heroes/NN-name.md` written *just before* implementation. Solo founder; one hero at a time.
- **Success metric**: founder personally using codevira daily on own projects 60 days post-GA. Stars/users are secondary.

### Cofounder pushbacks recorded (rejected by founder, on record)

1. Argued for staged shipping (4 heroes in v2.0, rest in v2.0.x patches over 3-6 months). Founder chose all-in-one.
2. Argued for separately shipping v1.8.1 hotfix to existing users (small but real risk of further crash logs). Founder chose to fold into v2.0.
3. Argued for engine umbrella name (Guardian/Sentinel) for marketing surface. Founder chose to keep brand as "codevira" only.

### Risks acknowledged

- Anthropic could ship native Claude Code memory inside the 14-week window
- 14 weeks of building blind without v2.0 GA — mitigated by alpha cadence
- Solo-founder energy at week 12+ is the historical danger zone

### What's next

- Week 1: Engine sprint begins. Build hook intercept layer, signal aggregation, policy plugin API.
- Week 2: Engine acceptance criteria green; Pillar 1 (UX install) work starts.
- Week 3: alpha.1 tag — Engine + Pillar 1 + Hero 4 (Blast-Radius).
