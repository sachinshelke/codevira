**Works with:** Claude Code · Cursor · Windsurf · Google Antigravity · any MCP-compatible AI tool

## The Problem

Every time you start a new AI coding session, your agent starts from zero.

It re-reads files it has seen before. It re-discovers patterns already established. It makes decisions that contradict last week's decisions. It has no idea what phase the project is in, what's already been tried, or why certain files are off-limits.

You end up spending thousands of tokens on re-discovery — every single session.

**Codevira fixes this.**

---

## What It Does

Codevira is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server you drop into any project. It gives every AI agent that works on your codebase a shared, persistent memory:

| Capability | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Context graph** | Every source file has a node: role, rules, dependencies, stability, `do_not_revert` flags |
| **Semantic code search** | Natural language search across your codebase — no grep, no file reading |
| **Roadmap** | Phase-based tracker so agents always know what phase you're in and what comes next |
| **Changeset tracking** | Multi-file changes tracked atomically; sessions resume cleanly after interruption |
| **Decision log** | Every session writes a structured log; past decisions are searchable by any future agent |
| **Agent personas** | Seven role definitions (Planner, Developer, Reviewer, Tester, Builder, Documenter, Orchestrator) with explicit protocols |

**The result:** ~1,400 tokens of overhead per session instead of 15,000+ tokens of re-discovery.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add to your project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachinshelke/codevira .agents
pip install -r .agents/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .agents/config.example.yaml .agents/config.yaml
```

Edit `.agents/config.yaml` for your project:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  watched_dirs: ["src"]          # directories to index
  language: python               # python | typescript | go | rust
  file_extensions: [".py"]
  collection_name: my_codebase
```

### 3. Build the index

```bash
# Builds code index + graph stubs + roadmap in one command
python .agents/indexer/index_codebase.py --full --generate-graph --bootstrap-roadmap

# Auto-reindex on every git commit
bash .agents/hooks/install-hooks.sh
```

### 4. Connect to your AI tool

**Claude Code** — add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Codevira": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [".agents/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — Settings → MCP → Add Server:
- Command: `python`
- Args: `.agents/mcp-server/server.py`
- Working directory: project root

**Windsurf / Google Antigravity** — same as Cursor via the MCP settings panel.

### 5. Verify

Ask your agent to call `get_roadmap()` — it should return your current phase and next action.

> **No roadmap yet?** No problem. `get_roadmap()` auto-creates a Phase 1 stub on first call. No setup required.

---

## Session Protocol

Every agent session follows `.agents/PROTOCOL.md`. Read it once — then your agents handle the rest.

**Session start (mandatory):**
```
list_open_changesets()      → resume any unfinished work first
get_roadmap()               → current phase, next action
search_decisions("topic")   → check what's already been decided
get_node("src/service.py")  → read rules before touching a file
get_impact("src/service.py") → check blast radius
```

**Session end (mandatory):**
```
complete_changeset(id, decisions=[...])
update_node(file_path, changes)
update_next_action("what the next agent should do")
write_session_log(...)
```

This loop keeps every session fast, focused, and resumable.

## Agent Personas

Seven role definitions in `agents/` tell each agent exactly what to do and when:

| Agent | Invoked When | Key Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator.md` | Every session start | Classify task, select pipeline |
| `planner.md` | Large or ambiguous tasks | Decompose into ordered steps |
| `developer.md` | All code changes | Write code within graph rules |
| `reviewer.md` | `stability: high` or `do_not_revert` files | Flag rule violations |
| `tester.md` | After every code change | Run the test suite |
| `builder.md` | After tests pass | Lint, type-check |
| `documenter.md` | End of every session | Update graph, roadmap, log |
