"""
_region_detect.py — which named symbol(s) does an edit land in?

This is the predicate symbol/region-level decision locking uses. v3.5.0's
content-aware lock (Phase 18) downgrades a block→warn when the diff's salient
tokens don't reference a locked decision's subject. Symbol-level locking goes
one step finer: a decision can be scoped to a *function or class* (not the
whole file), and the lock then blocks only when the edit actually lands inside
that symbol.

The crux: at ``PRE_TOOL_USE`` the edit has NOT been applied yet, so the target
file on disk still contains the edit's ``before`` text. We can therefore locate
that text as a substring, turn its offset into a 1-based line span, and ask
which AST/tree-sitter symbol ranges overlap it.

Pure-ish: one read of the target file, no writes, no graph DB. Defensive
everywhere — a parse failure, an unreadable file, or a ``before`` block that
can't be located returns ``None`` ("undeterminable"), and the caller falls back
to file-level behavior. Never raises.

Determinate-empty vs undeterminable
------------------------------------
``symbols_touched_by_edit`` distinguishes two "no match" cases:

* ``set()``  — determinate: the edit lands in module-level code that belongs to
  no named symbol (e.g. imports, top-level constants). The caller may treat a
  symbol-scoped decision as orthogonal.
* ``None``   — undeterminable: no diff envelope, ``before`` not found, parse
  failure, full-file Write, oversized input. The caller must NOT relax on this.
